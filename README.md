# paintmoji
An example of a realtime collaborative app based on [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb) and [Operational Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation).

**Demo: [https://paintmoji.onrender.com](https://paintmoji.onrender.com)**

(Note: this is hosted on [a Render free instance](https://docs.render.com/free), which spins down after some time of inactivity and it might take some more time to load if it's down, just keep this in mind when trying this project.)

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Run `npm install`.

## Usage

1. Run `npm start`.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on [Render](https://render.com) using a [Free Services instance](https://docs.render.com/free) and it's available at **[paintmoji.onrender.com](https://paintmoji.onrender.com)**.

Since we're using a free instance, [this instance spins down after some time of inactivity, and it will take a few seconds more to respond to a request if it needs to spin back up.](https://docs.render.com/free#spinning-down-on-idle) Just keep this in mind when trying this project demo.
